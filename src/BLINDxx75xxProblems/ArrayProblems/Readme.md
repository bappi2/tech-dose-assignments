# StringBuilder vs StringBuffer

Choose between `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer` based on your application's requirements.

- Use `StringBuilder` for single-threaded environments or when thread safety is not a concern. It is faster and more efficient because it lacks synchronization overhead.
- Use `StringBuffer` when working with multiple threads that manipulate the same object. It provides synchronized methods for thread safety, although it may have slightly lower performance due to the synchronization overhead.

Remember:
- `StringBuilder`: Fast and efficient, but not thread-safe.
- `StringBuffer`: Thread-safe, but slightly slower due to synchronization.

Consider the specific needs of your application when deciding which class to use.
