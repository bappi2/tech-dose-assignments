For any edge uv in an undirected graph, we call u a neighbor of v and vice
versa, and we say that u and v are adjacent. The degree of a node is its number
of neighbors. In directed graphs, we distinguish two kinds of neighbors. For
any directed edge uv, we call u a predecessor of v, and we call v a successor
of u. The in-degree of a vertex is its number of predecessors; the out-degree is
its number of successors.
